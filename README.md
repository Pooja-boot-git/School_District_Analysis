# School_District_Analysis
We have been assigned the task to analyze trends in schools' performance at individual and district levels based on reading and math scores. This should help the school board decide on future school budget allocation.

There was some discrepency found in the data of Thomas High School. It was decided to exclude scores of ninth graders from Thomas High School from our analysis. 

## District Summary

We considered only 10th, 11th and 12th graders from Thomas High School for our analysis. When you look at the all the schools in the district, it didnt make much of a difference in the overall data.

2. **We see a marked decrease in average math /reading score as well as the overall passing percetage when we included NULL values in our analysis. This gave us a wrong impression that average performance of the school was as low as 65%.**

## Summary/Inference
Following areas of our analysis would be affected if we include ninth graders having null values for scores in our analysis. That would in turn give us incorrect understanding of the data.

*  It would bring down the average scores/overall performace of the spending group Thomas High School belonged to. 
*  It would bring down the average scores/overall performace by school size Thomas High School belonged to. 
*  Thomas High School is a Charter Type school which by our analysis have formed better than district type schools. Using incorrect data would affect average scores/overall performace of all the Charter schools.
*  Overall performance of the school would drastically come down. Thomas High school belongs in the top 5 performing schools in the district. It would have brought it down to one of the lowest performing schools. 

Looking at the above details, we come to a conclusion that completely excluding NULL data from our analysis was a good decision.
