# School_District_Analysis
We have been assigned the task to analyze trends in schools' performance at individual and district levels based on reading and math scores. This should help the school board decide on future school budget allocation.

There was some discrepency found in the data of Thomas High School. It was decided to exclude scores of ninth graders from Thomas High School from our analysis.
